CURRENT

! If you use a random heading in your file, the system includes its tasks in the preceding group
Print group name even if group is empty
Synchronize how docs refer to "complete" with the codebase

LATER


Add 'later' command
Append timestamps on complete
Append commit logs on push

MAYBE

Import previous git commit messages and put into completed group, so that toga is already sexy
Scan for @todos in project and create `later` tasks for them
Support multiline tasks (kind of don't want to)



COMPLETED
Make toga commit interactive
